title: GitHub Rebase 36

As always, if you have neat projects you want to show off "send me a message!":http://rebase.github.com/howto.html. I usually try to keep a balance of language between the weeks, so don't lose hope if your project isn't in this time. Just please have a README so you can show others (and me!) how to setup/use your project.

h3. Featured Project

*"coffee-script":http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script* is what happens when too much Ruby and Python get mixed with your JavaScript. The result? A fantastic DSL that compiles down to executable JS and adds plenty of awesome features along the way. CoffeeScript offers a terse syntax, list comprehensions, existental operators to remove pesky @typeof@ checks, and a reliable inheritance model to boot. The list goes on and on, and for executable examples along with their compiled-to-JavaScript equivalents, "check out the docs":http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script. Some projects are already cropping up, including "rack-coffee":http://github.com/mattly/rack-coffee and even "a rewrite":http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/blob/master/examples/underscore.coffee of "underscore.js":http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/. GitHub's languages section "already recognizes":http://github.com/languages CoffeeScript, so get hacking!

h3. Notably New Projects

*"nv":http://github.com/scrod/nv*, or Notational Velocity, is an OSX desktop app that does just that: note taking. It approaches this simple task in a mouseless, modeless way, and user interaction is driven through incremental search. Can't find a note with you're starting to type, and a new one is instantly created and saved. The data's also not trapped on your own machine, you can hook it up to "Simplenote":http://simplenoteapp.com/, or to anywhere via "WriteRoom":http://wiki.github.com/scrod/nv/synchronizing-with-writeroom-iphone-via-simpletextws or "Dropbox":https://www.dropbox.com/. "Download it here.":http://notational.net/

*"jquery.fortune":http://github.com/mbadran/jquery.fortune/* is a replacement for Unix's "fortune":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix) in jQuery. Set up your fortune cookies "with JSON":http://mbadran.github.com/jquery.fortune/, hook it to an HTML element, and you're all set. "There's a live demo":http://mbadran.github.com/jquery.fortune/contentions/ if you want to see it in action. On the more practical side, this could be a great example of how easy it is to make a jQuery plugin. I'm just waiting for the first person to combine this with the "jQuery Konami Code.":http://www.newmediacampaigns.com/page/konami-code-jquery-plugin-pointlessly-easy

*"hubdroid":http://github.com/eddieringle/hubroid* is an Android app for keeping track of what's happening on GitHub while you're not hooked to your computer. So far, the app can look up the repos you're watching and own, forked repos, and the latest commits from a given repo. This has some rough edges and could use some help from the Android community if you're looking for a project to hack on. Being an Droid owner myself, I'm tempted to break out some Java to help contribute. It would be great to view commit diffs or your timeline in the app, or even post gists.
