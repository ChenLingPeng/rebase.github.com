h3. Featured Project

*"vanity":http://github.com/assaf/vanity* is an "experiment driven development":http://labnotes.org/2009/11/19/vanity-experiment-driven-development-for-rails/ framework for Ruby on Rails that uses "A/B Testing":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing to maximize how people interact with your site. The simple case is testing out switching out "two different page layouts":http://vanity.labnotes.org/index.html#intro to see which drives more signups. Set up and track metrics such as "referrals or acquisitions":http://500hats.typepad.com/500blogs/2007/09/startup-metrics.html, and then check it out in the built in dashboard using "Redis":http://github.com/antirez/redis. It's also quite easy to extend and bring in other services, such as "Google Analytics":http://www.viget.com/extend/user-goal-tracking-in-rails-with-vanity-and-google-analytics/. Get started split testing your app "here":http://vanity.labnotes.org/.

h3. Notably New Projects

*"jubilator":http://github.com/thumblemonks/jubilator* is a new slick way to browse repos that uses the "GitHub API":http://develop.github.com. It's packed full of some "previously-rebased":http://rebase.github.com projects such as "JQuery":http://github.com/jquery/jquery, "Sammy":http://github.com/quirkey/sammy, and "Mustache.js":http://github.com/janl/mustache.js. The end result is a AJAX powered repo interface with "syntax highlighting":http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/ that's a lot easier to view files if you don't want to clone the project. "Try it out":http://jubilator.thumblemonks.com/ on your repo!

*"bird-show":http://github.com/bhattisatish/bird-show* is a "Lift":http://liftweb.net/ web app that interacts with the "Flickr API":http://www.flickr.com/services/api/ to show pictures. Simple, yes, but this is a great starting point for newcomers to Lift (and Scala!) and comes complete with a "presentation":http://www.slideshare.net/dcbriccetti/birdshow-a-lift-app-for-showing-flickr-photos-2720594 and "tutorial video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDVaeYWUwfs on the app. You can browse some wildlife photoes "here on the live site":http://briccettiphoto.com/.

*"stacey":http://github.com/kolber/stacey* is a lightweight PHP content management system that follows in "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll's footsteps and works by generating static files off templates. Drop it onto your server with PHP installed, and you're all set to "start making pages":http://staceyapp.com/documentation/creating-pages/. It's baked in with a "templating language":http://staceyapp.com/documentation/editing-templates/ that doesn't require any PHP knowledge to use efficiently well. There's already a decent amount of "Stacey":http://staceyapp.com/installation/ sites online and a "growing support forum":http://getsatisfaction.com/stacey. The codebase is quite accessible around 500 lines, so "get hacking!":http://staceyapp.com

*"vz_analysis":http://github.com/hgimenez/vz_analysis* is a small R script that runs through some of the available statistics about GDP and inflation from the author's home country of Venezuela. It's a nice little example of using "ggplot2":http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/, a great library that can produce nearly any kind of common stats object for your graphs. Check out the "source":http://github.com/hgimenez/vz_analysis/blob/master/r/econ.r and maybe see how this can apply to some other "open datasets":http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/where_to_find_open_data_on_the.php.

*"yalfs":http://github.com/cmatei/yalfs* is yet another Lisp from scratch. Yes, it wouldn't be a Rebase without a fun toy programming project, and this one is special since the author is "blogging the project's goals and progress":http://yalfs.blogspot.com/. This implementation is done in straight C, and already has some basic datatypes implemented. So it might be a long way from tail recursion, but this is a neat project to keep an eye on if you're a language or functional programming geek.
